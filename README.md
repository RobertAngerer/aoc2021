# aoc2021
My Advent of Code solutions primarily implemented in python

I have almost no experience coding in Python, except a pattern recognition course I did at university in which we used Python
However I have never really explored the language and all its unique features

Therefore, this will be my attempt at solving all challenges of 2021 in Python
Hopefully I will look back one day at this repo and see the progress I made with each challenge solved
